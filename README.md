# Matter Fan POC

## Overview
This project demonstrates the **Matter Fan Proof of Concept (POC)** implementation using the Gecko SDK version 4.4.1 and Matter 2.2.0. It showcases how to integrate Matter protocol with Silicon Labs platforms to control a fan device.

## Features
- **Matter Protocol Support:** Built on Matter 2.2.0 for seamless IoT interoperability.
- **Fan Control:** Supports basic fan functionalities like turning on/off, speed adjustment, and direction control.
- **Gecko SDK Integration:** Utilizes Gecko SDK version 4.4.1 for efficient hardware abstraction and development.

## Requirements
- **Hardware:**
  - Silicon Labs **xG24** development board.
  - Optional peripherals like buttons, LEDs, and a PWM-enabled fan.

- **Software:**
  - Gecko SDK version 4.4.1.
  - Simplicity Studio v5 (or compatible development environment).
  - Matter 2.2.0 stack.
